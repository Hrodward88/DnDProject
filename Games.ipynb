This is the first Zelda game to be rated T by ESRB and 12+ by PEGI. The reason is probably because of violence, blood , and signs of nudity . This game is also notable for being the first console Zelda title released in the United States before Japan, as the Wii version was released in America on November 19, 2006, whereas the Japanese versions were released on December 2.
